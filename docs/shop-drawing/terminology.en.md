## 📖 How to Learn Terms

### 1. Learn by Category
Learn in order: Drawing types → Structural members → Rebar → MEP

### 2. Learn While Looking at Drawings
Effective to search for terms in actual drawings.

### 3. Learn Japanese and English Together
Useful for accessing overseas information and explaining to foreigners.

### 4. Use on Site
Using terms on actual sites helps retention.
