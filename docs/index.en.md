## 🏗️ What is Japanese Construction BIM?

At Japanese construction sites, BIM is utilized in the following flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Design Drawings] --> B[Shop Drawings]
    B --> C[BIM Models]
    C --> D[Clash Detection]
    D --> E[Construction]
    E --> F[As-Built Drawings]
```

### Key Points

1. **Shop drawings come first** - BIM models are based on shop drawings
2. **Used for clash detection** - Check interference between structure and MEP
3. **Practical use** - Not just 3D visualization, but problem-solving tools
4. **Continuous updates** - Models must be updated as construction changes
